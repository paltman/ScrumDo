<h2 alt="Permissions">Permissions</h2>
<p>The permissions enforced by the API are the same as on the website.</p>

<p>All access to iterations and stories is governed by access to the project that they are within. A user has read access to a project if they are a member, or if they are a member of a team that is assigned to that project. A user has write access if they are directly a member or if they are a member of a team of type "read/write" or "admin" that has access to the project.</p>

<p>Access to a team is based on access to the organization that the team belongs to. A user has read access to an organization if they are in any teams for that organization. They can write if they are an a team that has permission "admin".</p>
