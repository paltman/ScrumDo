<h2 alt="What is ScrumDo">What is ScrumDo?</h2>
<p>ScrumDo is an Agile/Scrum story management web application. It is a tool that allows developers to more easily utilize Agile methodologies in their work. Agile is a development methodology that is designed to adapt to rapidly changing requirements and develop functional software incrementally. We think this helps us write better software more quickly. One of the major ways of organizing Agile development is through Scrum, a concrete technique to deliver the more abstract goals of Agile: rapidly developed incremental software.</p>

<h2 alt="What is Scrum?">What is Scrum?</h2>
<p>At the heart of Scrum and ScrumDo are stories that describe specific features or experiences that a certain user could expect of the product. As features are thought of or discovered through user feedback, exploratory meetings, etc, they are described and added to the Backlog, which contains all stories that will eventually be implemented. These stories are assigned point values based on their relative difficulty. Since the requirements for stories may change often and some may be dropped and some added, development does not focus on anything that is in the Backlog. Rather, the development team decides on a certain time period (a Sprint), often two or four weeks, and allocates a certain number of high priority stories to that iteration. The idea is that at the end of that period there will be a working product that now has the additional features described by the stories. Since there is often no way of actually knowing what development will look like in four or eight weeks (based on changing requirements, etc), Scrum makes no attempt to do this. Rather, it focuses on delivering the most efficient work possible.</p>

<h2 alt="How ScrumDo Helps">How does ScrumDo help this?</h2>
<p>ScrumDo makes creating stories as easy as typing a sentance and hitting enter, creating iterations as easy as one click and entering a name and a date range, and allows you to drag and drop stories into iterations and back into the backlog. But it also allows you to assign point values, track your past progress and estimate how quickly you will be able to go through all the stories in your backlog based on your past rate. It allows you plan out iterations and even integrate with Github (and other sites in the future) to turn Github issues into stories or the reverse, or if you prefer to do it old school, export an iteration into excel or a CSV file and edit it by hand before uploading it back into ScrumDo. ScrumDo tries to make the process of Scrum as lightweight as Scrum allows your development to be.</p>
